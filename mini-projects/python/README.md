# 🐍 Python Projects

This folder contains my beginner-to-intermediate Python projects.  
Each project is organized in its own subfolder with code, notes, and a README.

## 📂 Project Index

### 🔹 Beginner Games
- [Rock Paper Scissors](./rock-paper-scissors/) — classic game with user vs computer play.
- [Number Guessing Game](./number-guessing-game/) — computer selects a number, user guesses with hints.
- [Dice Rolling](./dice-rolling/) — simulate rolling dice with random outcomes.

### 🔹 String & Utility Tools
- [Caesar Cipher](./caesar-sipher/) — text encryption and decryption using Caesar’s shift cipher.
- [Address Validator](./address-validator/) — validate and format addresses using Python string processing.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Random number generation (`random` module)
- Functions and modular design
- Input validation and error handling
- String manipulation and formatting
- Basic algorithms (Caesar cipher encryption/decryption)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand games with GUIs (Tkinter or Pygame)
- Extend Address Validator with regex and/or external APIs
- Add unit tests for each project
- Package selected tools for reusability

✨ Each project is small but demonstrates practical use of Python.  
They build the foundation for larger applications in **data, web, and systems programming**.
