# üêç Advanced Python Notes

This folder contains notes, examples, and projects that cover **advanced Python concepts** beyond intermediate coursework.  
The focus here is learning **professional, production-level Python** ‚Äî efficient, scalable, and clean.

---

## üìö Topics Covered

### Language Features
- Iterators & Generators (`__iter__`, `__next__`, `yield`, `yield from`)
- Decorators (function decorators, class decorators, chaining decorators)
- Context Managers (`with`, custom context managers, `contextlib`)
- Dunder methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, operator overloading)

### Concurrency & Parallelism
- Threading & multiprocessing
- Async IO (`async`, `await`, `asyncio`)
- Task scheduling and event loops
- When to use each concurrency model

### Type Safety & Clean Code
- Type hints (`typing`, generics, Protocols)
- Static analysis with `mypy`
- Linting & formatting with `flake8`, `black`, `pylint`

### Packaging & Environment Management
- Virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`)
- Poetry & setuptools basics
- Creating & publishing Python packages
- Dependency management and versioning

### Performance & Optimization
- Profiling (`cProfile`, `timeit`)
- Memory management (garbage collection, `sys.getsizeof`)
- Efficient data structures (`collections`, `heapq`, `deque`)
- Big-O complexity review in Python code

### Applied Python
- Data workflows with **NumPy** and **pandas**
- Plotting with **matplotlib**
- Basics of scikit-learn (ML intro with Python ecosystem)

## ‚úÖ Practice Checklist

- [ ] Write a generator function to handle infinite sequences  
- [ ] Build and use a custom decorator (logging, caching, timing)  
- [ ] Create a custom context manager (`__enter__`, `__exit__`)  
- [ ] Use `asyncio` to fetch data concurrently from multiple APIs  
- [ ] Add type hints to a medium project and check with `mypy`  
- [ ] Package a small project with Poetry and install it locally
