# 🐍 Python — Intermediate Notes

This folder contains my notes and practice code while following the **Codecademy Intermediate Python Course (YouTube)**.  
The focus here is to move from beginner Python into **structured, real-world programming**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (Codecademy Intermediate Python)
- Functions (arguments, return values, scope, lambda functions)
- Control flow in depth (nested loops, conditionals, truthy/falsy values)
- Lists & advanced operations (slicing, list comprehensions)
- Dictionaries (keys, values, iteration, nesting)
- Sets (unique collections, set operations)
- String formatting and manipulation
- File handling basics (reading, writing, working with text files)
- Error handling with `try` / `except`
- Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods, attributes)

---

## 📝 Notes Format
- Each major topic will have its own `.md` file with code snippets.  
  Examples:  
  - `functions.md`  
  - `lists.md`  
  - `oop_basics.md`
