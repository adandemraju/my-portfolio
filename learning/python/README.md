# 🐍 Python Learning Roadmap

This folder tracks my structured journey in Python, organized into **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**.  
Each subfolder contains notes, exercises, and mini-projects.  

---

## 📂 Structure

- **[Beginner](./beginner/README.md)** — Core Python syntax and foundations  
- **[Intermediate](./intermediate/README.md)** — Based on Codecademy’s *Intermediate Python* YouTube series  
- **[Advanced](./advanced/README.md)** — High-level Python features and professional concepts  

---

## 🗺️ Learning Path

### 🔹 Beginner
- Variables and data types  
- Control flow (if/else, loops)  
- Functions (parameters, return values)  
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  
- File handling basics  
- Simple CLI projects  

📘 *Goal:* Comfort with writing small programs and scripts.  

---

### 🔹 Intermediate (Codecademy YouTube Track)
- Functions (scope, lambdas, multiple arguments)  
- Lists & comprehensions  
- Dictionaries and sets  
- String formatting and manipulation  
- File input/output  
- Error handling (`try/except`)  
- Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, attributes)  

📘 *Goal:* Transition from basics → structured coding with reusable components.  

---

### 🔹 Advanced
- Iterators, generators, `yield`  
- Decorators and higher-order functions  
- Context managers (`with`, `contextlib`)  
- Concurrency (`threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`)  
- Type hints and static analysis (`typing`, `mypy`)  
- Packaging and environments (setuptools, poetry, venvs)  
- Performance profiling & memory optimization  
- Applying Python in **data workflows** (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)  

📘 *Goal:* Write **production-level Python** that is efficient, tested, and scalable.  

---

## ✅ Practice Routine
- Solve **1 LeetCode per day** (arrays, strings, recursion, DP, graphs).  
- Write notes in Markdown (`.md`) with code snippets.  
- Commit progress weekly.  
- Build 1–2 projects per level (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).  

---

## 🏗️ Project Ideas
- **Beginner:** To-Do list app, number guessing game, text-based calculator  
- **Intermediate:** Gradebook app, contact book, file-based word counter  
- **Advanced:** Async web scraper, mini data pipeline, custom Python package
